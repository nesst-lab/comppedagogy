HW1: strcmp(string1, string2) is case sensetive. Even by changing the capitalization of one letter changes the output. I tried strcmp('Yes','Yes') which gave the output of 1 (true). When I tried strcmp('Yes', 'yes'), the output was 0 meaning they are unequal.

HW2: I would expect the statment 'This exists!' to print because the file 'basic_pythagHypotenuse' already exists/is defined.
