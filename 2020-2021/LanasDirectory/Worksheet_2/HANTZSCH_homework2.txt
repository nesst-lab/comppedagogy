HW 1. oldWorkingDir and workingDir would not have the same value. oldWorkingDir will maintain the same value from the time the line was run - the only way to make it match the new workingDir value would be to run the line oldWorkingDir = workingDir a second time.
HW 2. oldWorkingDir  = 'workingDir'

HW 3. Yes, these variables are the same because the logical variable produced from this command was 1. In Logical variables, 1 = true, where 0 = false.

HW 4. No, anotherVector and columnVector would not be equivalent because columnVector is a 6x1 vector whereas anotherVector is 1x6. Thus, they do not have equivalent values. This can be checked using the command isequal(anotherVector,columnVector)

HW 5. newMatrix = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]
      newCellArray = {'a' 'b' 'c'; 'd' 'e' 'f'}
