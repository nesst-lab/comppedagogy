application check #1: if you wanted to list the contents of a folder other than the one that you are currently in, without moving into it, how would you do that? - you would use the command ls  ../ to tell it how far up you wanted it to go. 
application check #2: what if you wanted to go up multiple levels of folders? you would use ls ../../ with the number of "../" indicates how many levels of folders up you are going 
  
application check #3: how can you test whether comppedagogy has anything inside it? - you would have to navigate to comppedagogy from the command line and to view what is inside comppedagogy we will use ls comppedagogy
