1. I do not expect oldWorkingDir and workingDir to be the same value because workingDir has been redefined to show our new currently directory, not oldWorkingDir. 
2. oldWorkingDir = 'workingDir'
3. Yes, the two variables are the same and I know this because the logical variable I got when I used the isequal function was 1 which means that newVector and anotherVector have to be the same. If they were not the same I would have  gotten 0.
4. The dimensions of columnVector would be 6x1 which is different than newVector which has the dimensions of 1x6. Becuase of this, anotherVector and columnVector are not equivalent and I confirmed this using isequal(anotherVector,columnVector)
5. A variable that is a matrix of 2 rows and 3 columsn where the first row is 1,2,3 and the second row is 4,5,6 you name it and then the code would read as name = [1,2,3:4,5,6]. For the cell array the code would look like name = {'a','b','c',;'d','e','f'}
