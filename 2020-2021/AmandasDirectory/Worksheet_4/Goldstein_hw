1. I think that strcmp (string1, string2) is case sensitive
I could find this out by typing two things that are equal in Matlab using this command, making one capital and the other not and then seeing if matlab would put a 1/logical or 0/not logical. If 1/logical is produced then that means it is not case sensitive, as matlab would view them as equal despite the caps lock. If 0/not logical is produced, then we can determine it is case sensitive, as Matlab doesn't view the two as being equal.

2. yes, I would expect the statement 'This exists!' to print because I remember typing in matlab earlier 'basic_pythagHypotenuse', so I know it exists. I later  told matlab to print 'This exists!' if it does exist, hence I'd expect it to print that.

3. if isempty(emptyVariable)
   fprintf = 5
   end

4. if intVariable == 'SMAC'
fprintf('Your PI is Prof. Ben Parrell')
elseif intVariable == 'BLAB'
fprintf('Your PI is Prof. Carrie Niziolek')
else
fprintf('Oh no! You have no PI')
end 

5.hypotenuse = sqrt(leg1^2 + leg2^2); 
if round(hypotenuse) ~= hypotenuse
    hypotenuse = NaN; 
    fprintf('No Pythagorean triple exists with these two leg lengths\n');
end

The first line is definig the hypotenuse
The next line is rounding the number and checking to see whether or not it equals the hypotenuse
The next line determines if the hypotenuse is a number
if the number does not equal the hypotenuse, then the last line is telling matlab to print that No pythargorean triple exists with these two leg lengths
