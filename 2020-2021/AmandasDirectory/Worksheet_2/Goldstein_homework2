no, I do not expect oldWorkingDir and workingDir to be the same value because I took two different paths to get to each

oldWorkingDir = 'WorkingDir'

these two variables are the same. I know this because when I typed "isequal",it produced the number 1, which denotes that the statement was true, and hence the two variables are in fact the same

the dimensions of columnVector are 6 rows and 1 column or (6x1)
hence, I don't think that anotherVector and columnVector are equivalent, as they have different dimensions.
to determine if they were the same, I would type isequal (anotherVector,columnVector) into MATLAB and see whether or not it produces a 1 (meaning that they are equal) or a 0 (meaning that they are not equal)

aMatrix = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]
aCellArray= {'a b c';'d e f'}
