I think they will be the same variable because we assigned WorkingDir to a value and then made OldWorkingDir equal to this value as well. We then assigned the same value again to WorkingDir, so nothing should have changed. 


Homework item 2: 'oldworkingDir' = 'workingDir'

Homework item 3: when I clicked on "ans" in the workspace, there was a "1" in the cell. This shows that it is true that the two vectors are equal.

Homework item 4: the dimensions of columnVector is 6x1 because there is column and six rows. They are not equivalent because they don't have the same number of rows and columns (they are opposite).
 isequal(columnVector,anotherVector);

Homework item 5: 
matrix = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]
[{'a' 'b' 'c' ; 'd' 'e' 'f'}]
