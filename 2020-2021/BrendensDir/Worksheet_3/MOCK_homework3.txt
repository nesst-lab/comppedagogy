Homework item 1: The values that I had assigned for each side have now become the values for a, b, and c. This is becuase the basic_pythagTripleFunction assigns whichever value you input as a, b, and c.

Homework item 2: It should give me an output of 1 because that is the smallest value contained in the testVector.
