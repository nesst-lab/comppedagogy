Homework Item 1:
For argument 2 I might pick a trial that I need to refer to... [ 14 ]  or [14 220 277] or maybe a range of trials... [ 15:20]
For argument 3 I would need specify if I would like signalIn or signalOut

Homework Item 2:
audioGUI(cd, [1 2 3 4 ], 'signalIn', [ ], 0)

Homework Item 3: 
a. Argument 2
b. waverunner(datapath, [1 4 6])
c. LPC order

Homework Item 4:
a. On these lines we are causing each term to become a variable that will be referenced to sort data, the answer key referred to this as initiating and setting, although I was not aware of these terms myself. 
b. I have seen these terms when doing the final check with check_dataVals.
c. Lines 157-160 are sorting all of the trials that don't fall into the desired duration range, short trials are sorted into [shortTrials dataVals(i) .token], while long trials are sorted into [longTrials dataVals(i) .token]
d. Its somewhat of an educated guess based on the criteria we have set, we cannot be sure that the vowel formants are actually too long/short/NaN but based on our criteria we can get pretty close and then look at them ourselves.
