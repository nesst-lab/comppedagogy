Homework Item 1:
if a >  0 & b >0 
fprintf('hello world\n')
end

if round(a) == a & round(b) == b
fprintf('hello world\n')
end

if  a  ~= 0 & b ~= 0
fprintf('hello world\n')
end

if ~isempty(a) & ~isempty(b)
fprintf('hello world\n')
end

Homework Item 2:
if a > 0 | | b > 0
fprintf('hello world\n')
end

if round(a) == a | | round(b) == b
fprintf('hello world\n')
end

if a ~= 0 | | b ~= 0
fprintf('hello world\n')
end

if ~isempty(a) | | ~isempty(b)
fprintf('hello world\n')
end

Homework Item 3:
if xor(a>0, b>0)
fprintf('hello world\n')
end

if xor(isempty(a), isempty(b))
fprintf('hello world\n')
end

Homework Item 4:
false
true
true

a | (b & c)

Homework item 5:
I would assume there is no short-circuit version of xor because that function inherently demands both variables are checked to answer if only one of them is true. 

Homework item 6:
No,  because you should first check if the number of arguments is greater than 0. If not, you will get an error.

Homework item 7:
If a were a 4 I don't think MATLAB would print anything because we didn't define what we want it to print in the case that it is 4. We only did that for 5 and 6. 

Homework item 8:
It would be nice to use if/else when you maybe don't need to be as particular or only want to know the characteristic of a variable, like if it is greater than zero. Switch cases might be nice in a scenario when you want to be quite particular about a smaller number of variables and need to know if the variables are an exact output. 

Homework item 9:
a.
if strcmp(condWord, 'capper') || strcmp(condWord, 'gapper') 
max_events = 7; 
elseif strcmp(condWord, 'sapper') || strcmp(condWord, 'zapper') 
max_events = 6; 
elseif strcmp(condWord, 'sea') || strcmp(condWord, 'C') || strcmp(condWord, 'Z') || strcmp(condWord, 'czar') ...
|| strcmp(condWord, 'gar') || strcmp(condWord, 'cod') || strcmp(condWord, 'god')
max_events = 5; 
end

b. 
switch name
case 'sarah'
almaMater = 'UC Berkeley'; 
case 'robin'
almaMater = 'Cornell University'; 
otherwise
almaMater = '???';
end

c. 
Although I would have gotten this one wrong if not for checking in with the study guide, yes. You can change the else to otherwise to accomplish this.
