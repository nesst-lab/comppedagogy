I do think it is case sensitive. Uppercase letters can affect it because if could differentiate it between another string. I would find out by seeing that the result is 0 when I do myName = 'riya' and strcmp (myName,'Riya').

Yes I would expect it to print "This Exists" because it is there as a file. Therefore, I would most likely expect it to return a 2.
