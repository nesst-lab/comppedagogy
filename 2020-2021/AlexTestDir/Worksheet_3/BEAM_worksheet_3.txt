Item 1
A = 15
B = 17
C = 4
Variables A, B, and C have the values of side1, side2, and side3 because the function produces the results with the labels of A, B, and C, which overwrites any previous values set with these variable names.

SB: not exactly overwrites. When we put a red dot "breakpoint" in the script, it makes the script pause when it gets to that line. That means that we're looking at a, b, and c while the script is paused. What happens if you hit "continue"? What are a, b, and c equal to now that the script has finished executing? Were the variables overwritten, or is something else going on[, Sarah asked in a leading manner]?

AB: If we hit "continue", a, b, and c will now be equal to side1, side2, and side3. If I am understanding this correctly, a, b, and c are pretty much random/meaningless  variables until you get to the part of the script where they are assigned to a side of the triangle.

RK: Not quite. The function definition is:

basic_pythagTripleFunction(a,b,c)

so whatever variables/values you put in when you call the function will be immediately treated as a, b, and c in this function's workspace (which is different from the "base" workspace. The part of the function that assigns the values to a, b, and c is thus the function call itself, not any of the code inside the function.
