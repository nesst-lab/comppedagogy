% Homework 1
% Arugument 3:  signalOut
% RK: will just plain signalOut work? 

% Argument 2:  a specific trial number or a set of trials like "bods"
% RK: What is "bods"? 

% Argument 5:  booleans (T/F)

% an argument can be empy if it is left with empty brackets []
% audioGUI(cd, [1 2 3 4], 'signalIn', 0) would not set bSaveCheck to zero
% because it is the fifth argument, not the fourth. It would be set to one here
