I made a variable called string1, then tested it with strcmp to see if changing the case of the first letter still counted them as the same. 

test=string1
strcmp(test, 'String1') 
the answer was 0 so it is case sensitive as I guessed! 


Homework 3- 
if ~isempty(variable)
variable=3
end

I set up variable=[] then ran this to assign it 3.

Homework 2- yes 'This exists!' would print because that file does exist (it did) 

Homework 4-

var1='BLAB';
if strcmp(var1,'SMAC')
fprintf('Your PI is Prof Ben Parrell')
elseif strcmp(var1,'BLAB') 
fprintf('Your PI is Prof Carrie Niziolek')
else fprintf('Oh no, you have no PI!')
end 

Homework 5-

hypotenuse = sqrt(leg1^2 + leg2^2); #sets hypotnuse variable equal to the answer of sqrt of legs 1 and 2

if round(hypotenuse) ~= hypotenuse #if the hypotnuse is not a possible answer, it will be set to NaN
    hypotenuse = NaN; 
    fprintf('No Pythagorean triple exists with these two leg lengths\n'); #text printed if answer isn't possible 
end
