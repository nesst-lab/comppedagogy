1. strcmp(string1, string2) is case sensitive. You can test it out by comparing names with and without a capital letter, such as lauren and Lauren. The value you get back is 0, meaning they are not the same according to strcmp. 
2. I would expect 'This exists!' to  print since the basic_pythagHypotenuse is a function that exists in my path currently.
% RK: how does Matlab tell this if statement that it should print? 

% RK: items 3-5??
