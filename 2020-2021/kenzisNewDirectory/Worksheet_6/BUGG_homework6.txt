#2 A) I typed [logicVector] = contains(myCells, 'carrie'). Then, to find where Carrie was in the vector i typed find(logicVector)
Carrie is in cell 415
Ben is in 544
To find Alexa you would type alexas = myCells(contains(myCells, 'alexa'))

SB yes, but to be nitpicky and answer the specific yes/no question, you'd need anotehr statement to evaluate whether alexas is empty or not because the question was specifically yes/no (boolean). so:
isalexaheretoo= ~isempty(alexas)

#3 the ehVector contains the trial numbers in which the person is saying the vowel "eh".
waverunner([],ehVector...)


#1 200=736 504=295 830=130
