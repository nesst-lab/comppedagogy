% RK 10/14: are you sure about the last one? 
% MB 10/28: No, it is true.

a | (b & c)
#####
% RK 10/14: Is this false (as you predicted the last one would be)?
% MB 10/28: No, it is true too.

% short circuiting

% 1. I do not think there is a short-circut version of xor because only one of the
% statements in an xor can be true so you must evaluate both statements. 

% nargin < 1 would have to be the first statement in the code because once
% MatLab realizes that nargin is 0, it will stop evaluating. 

% switch-case statements

% the variable greeting for a = 4 doesn't exist so it produces an error.
% switch/case is that it can shorten the code so you don't have
% to deal with each value individually. 

#####
% RK 10/14: Not sure what you mean by this, and how it is separate from your explanation of if statements below? 
% MB 10/28: I meant that switch/case creates short cuts through the code so you don't have to alter each individual variable and it takes less time. With if/else statements I meant that it can shorten the process of dealing with multiple variables that would have used the same process anyway. So, instead of doing the same thing multiple times you use an if/else statement to do it all at once. 

% if/else statements can help ease the process of dealing with multiple
% cases that result in the same process at once. 

% Practice translating switch/case to if/else

condWord = 'tapper';
if strcmp(conWord, 'capper') ||

    % RK 10/14: you're missing something here to allow you to break lines 
    max_events = 7;
elseif strcmp(condWord, 'sapper') ||
    strcmp(condWord, 'zapper')
    max_events = 6;
elseif strcmp(condWord, 'sea') || strcmp(condWord, 'C') || strcmp(condWord, "Z") || strcmp(condWord, 'czar') || strcmp(condWord, 'cod') || strcmp(condWord, 'god')
    max_events = 5;

end
fprintf('%s earned her PhD at %s\n',name,almaMater);

% you cannot convert that to a switch/case because it has an else statement
% and that cannot be translated into a switch/case.

#####
% RK 10/14: you can, actually! Check back through the worksheet or do doc switch
% MB 10/28: Could you do this because you could eliminate the else if and use a case instead? I know the two types of functions are very similar so just changing out the if and if else's for switch and case would successfully change it to a switch/case?

#####
% RK 10/14: So I notice your first and third answer in this question are identical to Kathleen's, in such a way
% that it is almost impossible that there was not copying and pasting going on. Remember that these worksheets
% are not done for a grade, and are meant to teach you the programming tools necessary to work on coding in
% the lab. Simply copying and pasting someone else's answers won't help you at all, and allowing someone else
% to just copy and paste your answers doesn't help them either (though of course everybody in the lab has 
% access to this repository so that is not something you have total control over).
