strcmp is a case sensitive comparison of string 1 and string 2. You can find this out by typing strcmp(string1, string2) to compare the two strings to see if they are equivalent or not. It will return 0 if they are the same. 

RK: but what strings would you have to test? (what are string1 and string2?) Two different variables? 
RK (4/13): yes, but what are those variables set to? Give concrete examples. 
KB: strcmp(kenzie, Kenzie) 
RK (10/14): would this work? 
MB: No, it would not print out 0 because they are the same?

The variable 'This exists!' will print because the statement tells matlab to give you that variable if the thing you put into the statement does exist. 

RK: how does matlab tell that code snippet that the file exists? By checking the if exist('basic_pythagHypotenuse') function. 
RK (4/13): right, but what is the result of checking? 
KB: It would print a 2 because it does exist and the is a 2 because it is a file.
