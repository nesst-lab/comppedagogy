homework item 1:

if a > 0 & b > 0
fprintf('hello world')
end

bNNan = ~isnan(a & b)
if bNNan == 1
fprintf('hello world')
end

bNequal = a & b ~=0
if bNequal == 1
fprintf('hello world')
end

bNempty = ~isempty(a & b)
if bNempty == 1
fprintf('hello world')
end


homework item 2:

if a > 0 || b > 0
fprintf('hello world')
end

bNNan = ~isnan(a || b)
if bNequal == 1
fprintf('hello world')
end

bNequal = a || b ~=0
if bNequal == 1
fprintf('hello world')
end

bNempty = ~isempty(a || b)
if bNempty == 1
fprintf('hello world')
end


homework item 3:

if xor(a>0,b>0)
fprintf('hello world')
end

if xor(isempty(a),~isempty(b))
fprintf('hello world')
end


homework item 4:

a and b and c (1 & 1 & 0)
a and b or c (1 & 1 or 0)
a or b and c (1 or 1 and 0) is equal to (a | b) & c


homework item 5: 

I think that using the || would be an adequate short-circuit for xor. 


homework item 6: 

I don't think so for two reasons: 
1. dataPath may not exist
2. You can have empty arguments
But I am also unsure.


homework item 7:
 
my initial thought is that it would print out 'Charlotte says !' because there is no greeting for 4, only 5 and 6. 


homework item 8:

the advantages of using if/else is that it can operate logical statements, compared to switch/case. however, that is also an advantage of switch/case, is that it is a simple opertation for variables. 


homework item 9:

a.
if max_events = 7
fprintf('capper','gapper')
elseif max_events = 6
fprintf('sapper','zapper')
else max_events = 5
fprintf('sea','C','Z','czar','gar','cod','god')
end

b.
switch 'sarah'
case 'sarah'
almaMater= 'UC Berkeley'
case 'robin'
almaMater = 'Cornell University'
end

c.
I think you could translate it into a switch/case statement because its anatomy is fairly similar to that of else/if. I couldn't see why you couldn't add more variables to a switch/case statement.
