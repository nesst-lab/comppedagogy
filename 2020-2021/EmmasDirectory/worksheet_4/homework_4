Homework Item 1: 

No, the command strcmp(string1, string2) is not case sensitive.  I tested this
by running the command bDiffString('sarah', 'SARAH') and the output was boolean logic 1.  This means that string 1 did not equal string 2, so the capitalization had an impact on the output of the function.

Homework Item 2:

I am currently in the directory worksheet_4 in my personal directory in the 
commpedagogy folder, so I think that because that function is not in this directory or in the path, that the statement would evaluate to false.

Homework Item 3:

I created a function that checked to see if a function was empty and then
changed the value of that function to the integer 5.  I am currently working on it, but I am having dificulties changing the variable name to the integer
