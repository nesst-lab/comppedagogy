Homework Item 1: No, the workingDir variable and the oldWorkingDir variable will not have the same value.  This is because after the oldWorkingDIr variable is assigned to the workingDir variable, this variable is then reassigned to a new value, changing the value of the workingDir variable and making them different.

Homework Item 2: oldWorkingDir = 'workingDir'

Homework Item 3: yes, these variables are the same.  I am not exactly sure why the logical number 1 is true, but I think that this is a boolean logic expression, which means that the answer will either be True or False.  I think that 1 represents True and 0 represents False. So, since the logical number was 1, they are equivalent.

Homework Item 4: isequal(columnVector, newVector)

No, these are no equal, because the output of this was the logical number 0

Homework Item 5: 

matrix = [1 2 3 ; 4 5 6]

cell array  = {'a' 'b' 'c' ; 'd' 'e' 'f'}
