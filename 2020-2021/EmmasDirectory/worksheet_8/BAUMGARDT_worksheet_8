Homework Item 1: Write a for loop that squares all integers
from 40 to 50.

for integer = 40:50
    square = integer^2
    fprintf(the square of %d is %d\n')
end

** to get all the even numbers between 0 and 1000, you could
    still use the : notation:
    evenBelow1000 = [2:2:1000
    
    or, you can count by tens:
    countBy10 = [0:10:1000]

Homework Item 2: How would you definge a vector of ODD numbers
between 1 and 1000?

oddBelow100 = [1:2:1000]

Homework Item 3:

load('sampleBasicData/data.mat')
for trialIx = 1:length(data)
    trialFileName = [num2str(trialIx) '.mat'];
    fprintf('The file name for trial %d will be %s/n', tiralIx, trialFileName)
end

Homework Item 4:

for charIx = [1 4 12 18], Ix = 1:length(goodEvil)
officeCharacters(charIx).goodEvil = goodEvil(Ix)
end

^^^ this is wrong... but the answer is:

goodEvilAvailable = [1 4 12 18];
for i = 1:length(goodEvilAvailable)
    charIx = goodEvilAvailable(i)
    officeCharacters(charIx).goodEvil = goodEvil(i)
end

Homework Item 5:

load('words4trials.mat')
trials2run = 31:60
for i = 1:length(words4trials)
    trialNumber = trials2run(i);
    word = words4trials{i};
    fprintf('the word for trial %d is %s\n', trialNumber, word)
end
