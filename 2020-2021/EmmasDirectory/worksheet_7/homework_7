Homework Item 3:
one field that is a cell array is the conds field.  I found this with the code:

class(expt.conds)
ans = 'cell'

aCellArray = expt.conds

one field that is a double array is the allWords field.  I found this with the code:

class(expt.allWords)

ans = 'double'

aDoubleArray = expt.allWords

Homework Item 4:

Individual formants are stored in a column, this is probably because each trial has all four formants, so you can index by trial number first then by the formant that you want from that trial.

the line of code to get the second formant from the hypothetical 15th trial, using the matrix 'formants' is : forment2 = formants(15, 2)

the line of code to get the third forment from the hypothetical 30th trial is:
formant3 = formants(30, 3)
