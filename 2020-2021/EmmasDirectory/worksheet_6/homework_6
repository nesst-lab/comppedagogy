Homework Item 1:
200th: 736
504th: 295
830th: 130

myCells(1) : this resturned a 1 by 1 cell array with the string 'robin'
myCells{1} : this returned the string 'robin'

Homework Item 2:
To find 'carrie':

[logicVector] = contains(myCells, 'carrie')
find(logicVector)

ans = 415

To Find 'ben'
[logicVector] = contains(myCells, 'ben')
find(logicVector)

ans = 544

Bonus:
I looked up for a code that tells us if there is any nonzeros, called any. so I used that on the logicVector to see if any of the elements were non zero:

[logicVector] = contains(myCells, 'alexa')
any(logicVector)

ans = 0

Homework Item 3: 
the ehVector is the vector that has all the indecies of all the 'eh's

a command for waverunner to run just over these indecies would be:

waverunner([], ehVector, [], [], [])
