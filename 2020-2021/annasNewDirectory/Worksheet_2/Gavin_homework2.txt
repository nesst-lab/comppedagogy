I think they will be the same variable. We assigned WorkingDir a certain value and then assigned it to equal.

Homework item 2: 'oldworkingDir' = 'workingDir'

Homework item 3: workplace shoes there is a '1' in the cell so we know it is a vector

Homework item 4: the dimensions are 6x1. They are not equal because there are not the same number of rows as columns. 

Homework item 5: 
matrix = [1 2 3;4 5 6]
[{'a' 'b' 'c' ; 'd' 'e' 'f'}]
