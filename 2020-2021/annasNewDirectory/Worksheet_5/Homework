homework 1: 

somewhat confused. One option could be putting 25 for trail number 25?? Pretty lost on this one. 

Homework 2: audioGUI(cd, [1 2 3 4], 'signalIn', 0) --> audioGui(cd, [1 2 3 4], 'signalIn', [], 0)

Homework 3: 

a. second argument and trial trials 2 track. 
b. waverunner(datapath, all trials, signalIn, bsavecheck,[1,4,6]

Homework 4: 

a. variables.
b. terms on the side when doing check_dataVals
c. trialparams. sigpoc_params = sigproc_params; (sets variable)
if exist('bCopyParams','var') & bCopyParams == 1 (if bCopyParams exists)
trialparams.event_params = event_params; (then trialparams.event_params is set to event_params)
d. educated guess that is based on the values assigned when going through trials.
