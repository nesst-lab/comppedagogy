### Worksheet G3: Adding Practice for Gorilla Experiments

#### Skills introduced: Creating a Forced Choice Task in Gorilla 
* Triggering buttons with a mouse click or F/J keys
* Setting text of buttons via manipulation and randomizing this in the experiment setup

#### Add the stimuli
The stimuli can be accessed through OneDrive. Navigate to C:\Users\(insert your pawprint here)\OneDrive - University of Missouri\nesstlab\experiments\standardGorilla\sound stimuli.
Upload the following files into the stimului page of Gorilla: set 65 dB, sit 65dB, sat 65dB, suit 65dB, F image and J image. 

### Make the displays
There will be **6 displays** for this experiment:
1. Instructions
2. Practice
3. Trials
4. Filler
5. Break
6. Finish

#### Instructions

#### Practice
The practice will be hard-coded. You can copy the end of practice screen from NeSST Lab ornaments and edit it to suit this task. 

#### Trials and Filler
The trials and filler displays will each have **2 screens**:
* Present stimulus: This screen will include a fixation cross with a 2000 ms display time and 100 ms post display time, a progress bar, an audio clip, and an early exit button.
* Respond: This screen will include a progress bar, an early exit button, 

#### Break and Finish
You can copy the break and end of task screen from NeSST Lab ornaments. 

#### Set up the spreadsheet
There will be 7 blocks in this experiment, consisting of 4 blocks of "Trials" and 3 blocks of "Filler." Each block of trials will have 26 total, while each block of filler will have 20 total. There will be a break between each block of trials. The entire spreadsheet should have 173 rows.
