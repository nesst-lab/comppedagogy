## NeSST's INC (Intro to NeSST Computing) series
### Worksheet G3: Adding Practice for Gorilla Experiments

#### Skills introduced: Creating a Forced Choice Task in Gorilla 
* Triggering buttons with a mouse click or F/J keys
* Setting text of buttons via manipulation and randomizing this in the experiment setup
* Creating a progress bar to display task progress to participants 
* Using the scorer component and storing variables to display participant's score

#### Before going through this worksheet you should:
* Have completed worksheet G2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Add the stimuli
The stimuli can be accessed through OneDrive. Navigate to C:\Users\(insert your pawprint here)\OneDrive - University of Missouri\nesstlab\experiments\standardGorilla\. Then navigate into the sound and picture stimuli folders. Upload the following files into the stimului page of Gorilla: set 65 dB, sit 65dB, sat 65dB, suit 65dB, F image and J image. 

### Make the displays
There will be **6 displays** for this experiment:
1. Instructions
2. Practice
3. Trials
4. Filler
5. Break
6. Finish

#### Instructions
The information that you need to convey to participants in this study:
* They will hear a sound clip
* Next they will see buttons corresponding to different words: set and sit or suit and suit
* They have the option to respond either by clicking the button or using their keyboard
* They should respond quickly and accurately
* Selecting a word will move them to the next trial

#### Practice
The practice will be hard-coded. The practice will include the same screens as trial and filler. You can copy the end of practice screen from NeSST Lab ornaments and edit it to suit this task. Additionally, add a final short instructions screen before the participant moves to the experimental task. Inform the participant that the task will take 5 minutes, there will be 7 blocks, there will be breaks, along with a progress bar letting them know how far they are in the task. 

#### Trials and Filler
The trials and filler displays will each have **2 screens**:

**Present stimulus:** This is the screen that displays the stimulus to the participant. This screen will include the following objects:
1.) A progress bar
2.) an early exit button.
3.) A fixation cross with a 2000 ms display time and 100 ms post display time, 
4.) An audio clip

**Respond:** This is the screen in which the participant completes the "forced" choice by responding either by clicking or button or pressing a key on their keyboard. This screen will include the following objects:
1.) A progress bar
2.) An early exit button
3.) 2 buttons (copying from NeSST Lab ornaments and modifying can be helpful)
4.) 2 Images (F and J)

#### Using Multiple Triggers

#### How to Use the Progress Bar Component

#### Break and Finish
You can copy the break and end of task screen from NeSST Lab ornaments and edit as needed.  

#### Set up the spreadsheet
There will be 7 blocks in this experiment, consisting of 4 blocks of "Trials" and 3 blocks of "Filler." Each block of trials will have 26 total, while each block of filler will have 20 total. There will be a break between each block of trials. The entire spreadsheet should have 173 rows. You will need a column for the correct answers and a column for randomizing the trials within each block.
