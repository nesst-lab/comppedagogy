## NeSST's INC (Intro to NeSST Computing) series
### Worksheet G1: Adding Practice for Gorilla Experiments

#### Skills introduced: 
* Learn how to add randomized practice trials to an experiment
* Copying screens

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Before going through this worksheet, you should:
* Have completed worksheet G2 and created the Speech Stoop Task.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Why Practice?
In most of our experiments, we have a practice run of the experimental task before we start the actual experiment. When we are in person, this helps us determine if someone has understood the experiment, or if they need clarification on some of the instructions. Obviously we can't do that for online studies. However, practice runs also help the participant learn what to expect, so that they can get used to the pace and demands of the experiment before it actually starts. 

**Further Consideration 1**: Why would you tell a participant that practice will start right away?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Making the Displays
There will be four displays:
1. Practice 
2. Randomized Practice Instructions
3. Randomized Practice Trials
4. Randomized Practice Post

#### Stimuli
You will use the same stimulus words from worksheet G1. The best words to use are those that represent the full complexity of the experimental task. This means including some words that are more difficult for the participant and some that are easier. (This doesn't apply as much to this practice task.)

#### Instructions
Make sure the instructions are informative but not too wordy. The participant has already seen the instructions for the entire experiment, so the function of these instructions is to serve as a quick refresher on the task. 

#### Practice Display
This display sets up the "bones" of 2 trials. 
The trials will include:
1. A fixation cross for 800 ms
2. The stimulus word
3. A buffer (blank screen of 1.2 seconds)

* The fastest way to create this is by copying screens from previous displays. Click the drop down arrow of a screen by the screen's name, then select "copy screen", then paste the screen by following the same process on an empty screen and selecting "paste screen." Make sure to rename the screens. 

#### Randomized Practice Trials
This display includes the trials with the same layout as the practice display. 

#### Randomized Practice Post
This display will include two buttons: one button that will send the participant back to the beginning to redo the task, and another that will allow them to continue to the actual experimental task. Give each button a that tells you what it's purpose is (ex: "try again") and a label that tells the participant what it does (ex: "I want to practice again")

#### Edit the spreadsheet
Set up the spreadsheet to have a logical flow of displays so that the instructions are first, then six randomized practice trials, and lastly the post practice display. Make sure that the instructions for the practice come after the instructions for the whole experiment.

#### Preview the experiment and commit the changes

**Further Consideration 2**: If a participant wants to redo the practice trials, would the stimulus words on the second practice be new randomized words? 

### You are now ready to proceed with Worksheet G3!

Answers:

FC 1:  Many people expect some delay between clicking a button and having to speak, so it is good to warn people that they will have to start speaking right away.
FC 2: No, the stimulus words will be the same as they were the first time that the participant did the practice. This is because
