## NeSST's INC (Intro to NeSST Computing) series
### Worksheet G1: Adding Practice for Gorilla Experiments

#### Skills introduced: 
* Learn how to add randomized practice trials to an experiment
* Copying screens

#### Before going through this worksheet, you should:
* Have completed worksheet G2 and created the Speech Stoop Task.

### Why Practice?
In most of our experiments, we have a practice run of the experimental task before we start the actual experiment. When we are in person, this helps us determine if someone has understood the experiment, or if they need clarification on some of the instructions. Obviously we can't do that for online studies. However, practice runs also help the participant learn what to expect, so that they can get used to the pace and demands of the experiment before it actually starts. 

#### Making the Displays
There will be four displays:
1. Practice 
2. Randomized Practice Instructions
3. Randomized Practice Trials
4. Randomized Practice Post

#### Stimuli
You will use the same stimulus words from worksheet G1. The best words to use are those that represent the full complexity of the experimental task. This means including some words that are more difficult for the participant and some that are easier. (This doesn't apply as much to this practice task)

#### Instructions

#### Randomized Practice Trials

#### Randomized Practice Post

#### Edit the spreadsheet
Set up the spreadsheet to have a logical flow of displays so that the instructions are first, then 6 randomized practice trials, and lastly the post practice display. Make sure that the instructions for the practice come after the instructions for the whole experiment.

#### Preview the experiment and commit the changes
