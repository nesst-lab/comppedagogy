1. you now which directory you are in by running cd
2. ls will tell you what is in the folders

application check #1: you can check contents of a different folder you aren't currently in by running ls followed by the folder name
application check #2: you can move up multiple folders by doing cd ../../ (repeating '../' for as many folders as you need to move up
application check #3: you can see if comppedagogy has anything in it by navagating to that folder and running ls or doing ls comppedagogy

no that would not work because I would not be in the comppedagogy folder. you hahave to be in the folder you wish to see the contents of to run ls`
