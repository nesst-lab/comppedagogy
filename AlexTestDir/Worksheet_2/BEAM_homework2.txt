Item 1: Do you expect oldWorkingDir and WorkingDir to be the same value? Why or why not?

I do not expect oldWorkingDir and WorkingDir to be the same value because when I redefined WorkingDir, I had moved to a different directory 
than the one that I had defined oldWorkingDir in.

oldWorkingDir = C:\\Users\Public\Documents\comppedagogy , WorkingDir = C:\\Users\Public\Documents


Item 2: What command would you ACTUALLY use if you wanted to make a variable called oldWorkingDir be the string workingDir?

oldWorkingDir = newWorkingDir

# This isn't correct---check again what the question is asking you to do!
# Updated answer  


Item 3: Are these two variables the same? How do you know?

These two variables are the same because ans = 1, and we set bTestMode to equal 1 when true.


Item 4: If [1 2 3 4 5 6] is 1x6 because there is one row and six columns, what are the dimensios of columnVector? 

6x1

Do you think anotherVector and columnVector are equivalent? Why or why not?

I do not think that anotherVector and columnVector are equivilent because they do not have the same dimensions and cannot be compared.
I would check this with the command isequal(anotherVector, columnVector)


Item 5: How would you define a variable that was a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns, where the first row was 1 2 3 and the second
row was 4 5 6?

variableName = [1 2 3 ; 4 5 6]

Now do the same thing, but for a cell array, where row 1 has a b c, and row 2 has d e f. 

variableName = {'a' 'b' 'c' ; 'd' ''e' 'f'}
