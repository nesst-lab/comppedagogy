% Homework 2

% I do not expact oldWorkingDir and workingDir to be the same value.
% After setting oldWorkingDir to equal workingDir, we changed to a different
% directory. This new directory was set to the variable workingDir. 
% Therefore, oldWorkingDir is equal to the first workingDir in the worksheet,
% and workingDir is the most recent one.

% oldWorkingDir = '/MATLAB Drive'
% Not sure that I am interpreting this question correctly, never got it
% correct last semester.

% newVector and anotherVector are the same because the isequal command
% produced a '1'.

% The dimensions of columnVector are 6x1
% I do not think that columnVector and anotherVector are equivilant because 
% one is a 6x1 array and the other is a 1x6 array.

% matrix = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]
% cellArray = {'a' 'b' 'c'; 'd' 'e' 'f'}
