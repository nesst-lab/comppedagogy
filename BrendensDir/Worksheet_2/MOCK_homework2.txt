oldWorkingDir and workingDir will not be the same value. This is because I assigned oldWorkingDir to the original workingDir, therefor oldWorkingDir holds the value of the initial workingDir, not the new one that i created while in a different directory. 

Homework item 2: oldWorkingDir = 'workingDir'

Homework item 3: I know the variables are the same because it gave the answer of "1" which means true. "0" means false. 

Homework item 4: The column vector is six rows and one column. Therefor anotherVector and columnVector are not equivalent, this is because anotherVector has only one row and six columns. To be sure you could run the comman "isequal (anotherVector,columnVector)"

Homework item 5: 
newMatrix = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]
aCharCellArray = ({'a b';'d e f'})
