   %% strings and cells
     myCells(1) returns {'robin'}, the cell of the array
     myCells{1} returns 'robin', the value of the array

2)
  a. [logicVector] = contains(myCells,'carrie')
  b. find(logicVector) = 415 %carrie is at place 415
  c. [logicVector] = contains(myCells,'ben')
     find(logicVector) = 544 %ben is at place 544 
Bonus: Alexa is not here.
 [logicVector] = contains(myCells,'alexa')
 alexas = sum(logicVector)  %alexas = 0 so Alexa is not in the vector

3)
