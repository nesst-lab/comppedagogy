% Homework item 1: Do you expect oldWorkingDir and workingDir to be the same value?  Why or why not?  Use the Workspace
% window to examine these variables and check your answer. If you were wrong, try to figure out why. 
% 
% Use vi to create a text file in your Worksheet_2 directory with your explanation and thought process, called
% LASTNAME_homework2.txt
% ***

% Homework item 2: what command would you ACTUALLY use if you wanted to make a variable called oldWorkingDir be the string
% workingDir? You can experiment in the Matlab command window until you have it right. Remember that you can recall the value
% of a variable by typing in its name and hitting enter. 
% 
% When you have the command, use vi to edit your homework text file to include this command. 
% ***

% *** 
% Homework item 3: This command gives you a logical variable as the answer. Are these two variables the same? How do you
% know? Include your answer in your homework 2 text file.

% Homework item 4: 
% If [1 2 3 4 5 6] is 1x6 because there is one row and six columns, what are the dimensios of columnVector? 
% 
% Do you think anotherVector and columnVector are equivalent? Why or why not? Include your reasoning and the
% command you would use to determine this in your homework 2 text file.

% Homework item 5: a matrix (pl. matrices) is basically a vector that has two (or more) dimensions, i.e. both columns and
% rows. How would you define a variable that was a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns, where the first row was 1 2 3 and the
% second row was 4 5 6? 
% 
% Now do the same thing, but for a cell array, where row 1 has a b c, and row 2 has d e f. 
% 
% You can experiment in Matlab until you figure these out. When you have your solutions, edit your homework 2 text file using
% vi to include them.
