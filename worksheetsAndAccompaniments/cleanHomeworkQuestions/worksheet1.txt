% Homework item 1: Before starting this worksheet, use Terminal (/git bash) to create a new directory called Worksheet_1 in 
% your personal directory inside comppedagogy. 
% *** 

% *** 
% Homework item 2: After you've navigated into comppedagogy, take a screenshot of your Matlab window and save it in your
% Worksheet_1 directory. If you do not know know how to take a screenshot, go to this page:

% Homework item 3: You can rearrange your command/editor/workspace/etc. windows however you like. This includes popping them 
% out (I personally like my Variables window popped out, rather than docked), resizing (my Current Folder window is usually a
% little narrower than default), completely rearranging (my Workspace is on the right side of the screen instead of the 
% default left), etc. Make at least ONE change to your default so that your Matlab space is more intuitive to you. Take a 
% screenshot and save it to your Worksheet_1 directory. 
% 
% (If you actually liked everything at default, you can just change it back. If you've already made a change because you've 
% worked with Matlab before, just send a screenshot of your current space, as it will be different from default already.)

% ***
% Homework item 4: Once you have gotten the countdown on how much time you have left, create a text file using vi in your
% Worksheet_1 directory in the comppedagogy repo, called LASTNAME_homework1.txt
% 
% In the body of this text file, write down how much time there is left according to this script. Save and quit. 
% *** 

% *** 
% Homework item 5: Push all your changes! But remember to pull first :) 
% 
% If you have any questions about this worksheet or anything we've covered in BASIC, feel free to message the Basic Slack
% channel (if you think others might have the same question and would benefit---which is probably very likely!!) or DM Sarah
% and/or me in Slack if you'd rather ask privately.
