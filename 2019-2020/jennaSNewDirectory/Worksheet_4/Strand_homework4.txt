Homework 1: strcmp(string1, string2) is case sensitive because I tested strcmp('jenna', 'Jenna') and the the outcome function was 0, meaning they are not equal.

Homework 2: I would expect 'This exists!' to print because a condition was met for the if statement, and it is included in the function fprintf('This exists!\n').
