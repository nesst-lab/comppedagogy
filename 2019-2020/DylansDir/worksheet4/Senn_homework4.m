%1.  Yes, you can test it with:
bEqual = strcmp("case","Case");
if bEqual
	fprintf("strcmp is not case sensitive")
else
	fprintf("strcmp is case sensitive")
end

% RK: this works but of course the only line you need is the first one. 

% 2. Yes, any number greater than 0 would evaluate to true, and any
% existing object would return a value greater than 0

% RK: careful of the phrasing---not sure if you've misphrased something here or if you've made an inaccurate
% statement.
