1. 736, 295, 130

2.  a) logicVector = contains(myCells, 'carrie')
  b) cell 415
  c) cell 544

Bonus) loop through vector and check every value with conditional

SB: Sure, but can you think of an alternate way similar to 3a above?

3. a) indeces from vowels vector of expt that contain 'eh'

b) waverunner file not in git, my guess is something like waverunner(param, param, 'eh' OR ehVector, param, param)

SB: you can remote in to a Waisman computer to check out waverunner.
