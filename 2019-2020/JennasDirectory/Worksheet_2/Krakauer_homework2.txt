1. workingDir and oldWorkingDir are not the same because I navigated to a new directory.
2. oldWorkingDir = 'workingDir'
3. These two answers are the same because isequal gave a logical 1 which is true. The only difference between them are the commas in anotherVector, but this makes no difference.
4. columnVector is 6x1. They are not equivalent, and the command I would use is isequal(columnVector,anotherVector)
5. matrix = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]
   array = {'a' 'b' 'c';'d' 'e' 'f'}
