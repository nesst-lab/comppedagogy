1. I expect oldWorkingDir and workingDir to be different now because we assigned workingDir to a new value. This new value does not change oldWorkingDir because it has already been defined. 

2. oldWorkingDir = 'workingDir';

3. The logical value it gives back is 1, which means that the results are true and newVector is equal to anotherVector. 

4. THe dimensions of columnVector are 6x1. No, I do not think that columnVector and anotherVector are equal because their dimensions are different, even though they contain the same numbers. I would use this command: isequal(columnVector, anotherVector). 

5. matrix = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]; cellArray = {'a' 'b' 'c'; 'd' 'e' 'f'};
