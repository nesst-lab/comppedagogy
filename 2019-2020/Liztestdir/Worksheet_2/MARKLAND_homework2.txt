1. I would have expected them to be the same value, and they were the same (using MATLAB online version) 

Hmm, try again! First we set oldWorkingDir to pwd, then we changed directory...

Then they would not be ther same value, thank you!

2. oldWorkingDir = 'workingDir'
3. Yes, the variables are the same because they are the same vectors and the values were denoted with a 1.
4. 6x1, they are not equivalent because the command isequal (anotherVector, columnVector) showed a value of 0. 
5. matrix = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6] and cellarray = {'a' 'b' 'c'; 'd' 'e' 'f'}
