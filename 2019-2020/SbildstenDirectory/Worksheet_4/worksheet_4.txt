% RK 10/14: I would recommend running your full solutions in Matlab after you've written them out to check and debug 

Homework

item 1:
Yes, it is case sensitive. 
You could run bSameString=strcmp(string1,string2) 

#####
% RK 10/14: what are examples of what the variables string1, string2 would have to be set to in order to test if strcmp is case sensitive? 

item 2:
no I wouldn't expect it to print because exists('nameOfSomething') can have multile outputs depening on which type of  file it is and all of those conditions haven't been specified for.

#####
% RK 10/14: look back at what if statements do with numbers! 

item 3:

if isempty(var)
    var = 1
else
    continue
	##### 
	% RK 10/14: you don't actually need this continue statement (or the else statement)
end 

item 4:
##### 
% RK 10/14: how are you defining what these variables SMAC and BLAB are? 

if ~isempty(SMAC)
   fprintf('Your PI is Prof. Ben Parrell')
elseif ~isempty(BLAB)
   fprintf('YOur PU is Prof. Carrie Niziolek')
else
   fprintf('Oh No! You have no PI')
end

% RK 10/14: :( poor item 5
