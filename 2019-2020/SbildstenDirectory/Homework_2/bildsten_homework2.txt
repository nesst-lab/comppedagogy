% RK 9/28/2020: In the future please include question numbers on your answers! 

1. you would expect the two different variables to have the same output because they are set equal to eachother

% RK 9/28/2020: Reconsider the sequencing of how these variables are assigned! 

2. oldWorkingDir = 'workingDir'

these two variables have the same value. i know this because they are set equal to each other. WorkingDir is set equal to pwd and oldWorkingDir is set equal to WorkingDir, making it also have the same value. 

% RK 9/28/2020: How would Matlab tell you that they are equivalent? Also, they don't have the same variables, they have the same values (the elements of the variables are not variables, they are hard-coded values) 

3. the two variables share the same dementions and values. The variables themselves are different but their values are equal to each other. 

% RK 9/28/2020: try again!
4.i would use the command isequal(columnVector,anothercolumnVector) to varify this. I would know I was correct if i recieved a logical variable, 1, as the answer.

% RK 9/28/2020: which logical variable? 

5, newMatrix = [1,2,3;4,5,6]
 anotherMatrix = {'a' 'b' 'c' ; 'd' 'e' 'f'}
