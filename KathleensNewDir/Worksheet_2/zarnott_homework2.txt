3. Yes, the two variables are the same. I know this because the logical variableI got was 1 when I used the isequal function, meaning that newVector and anotherVector must be the same. 1 means they are equal. 

2. oldWorkingDir = 'workingDir'

1. I do expect oldWorkingDir and workingDir to be the same value after I correctly renamed it but not before because when we first named workingDir = pwd, it means that pwd and workingDir are the same thing. Now pwd is called workingDir, based we must rename oldWorkingDir for it to be be the same thing..

SB: I think you're getting at this but just to clearly state it here: we don't expect them to be the same because we redefined workingDir to reflect our new current directory. 


5. To define a variable that is a matrix of 2 rows and 3 colums where the first row is 1,2,3 and the second row is 4,5,6, you would name it (I named it lastVector) and then enter the code and all of it would read as lastVector = [1,2,3;4,5,6]; because the ; seperates columns. For the cell array, I did the same thing but named it secondCellArray and used different brackets. The code looks like this secondCellArray = {'a','b','c';'d','e','f'};

4. The dimensions of columnVector would be 6x1, instead of 1x6 like newVector. Based on that, I do not think that another and columnVector are equivalent. The command that you would use to confirm this is isequal(anotherVector,columnVector); When you run this code, you get the ans of 0, which means false whereas 1 would mean true.
